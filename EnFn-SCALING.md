# Scaling of E_n and F_n (Clean Markdown)

This document derives the scaling rules for the **Exponential component (E_n)** and the  
**Fibonacci component (F_n)** step by step, using **plain Markdown only** so it renders
cleanly on GitHub, Notion, Obsidian, VS Code, and standard viewers.

## 1. Given values for E_n

Initial sequence (as provided):

E_n = 1, 5, 17, 53, ...

---

## 2. Identify the recurrence for E_n

Check how each term is produced:

- 1 → 5  
  5 = 3·1 + 2

- 5 → 17  
  17 = 3·5 + 2

- 17 → 53  
  53 = 3·17 + 2

This gives the recurrence:

E_n = 3·E_(n−1) + 2  
with seed value:

E_0 = 1

---

## 3. Solve the recurrence (closed form)

We solve:

E_n = 3·E_(n−1) + 2

### 3.1 Homogeneous part

Ignoring the constant term:

E_n = 3·E_(n−1)

This has the solution:

E_n = C·3^n

### 3.2 Particular solution

Assume a constant solution E_n = k:

k = 3k + 2  
k − 3k = 2  
−2k = 2  
k = −1

### 3.3 General solution

E_n = C·3^n − 1

### 3.4 Apply the initial condition

Using E_0 = 1:

1 = C·3^0 − 1  
1 = C − 1  
C = 2

### 3.5 Final closed form

E_n = 2·3^n − 1

---

## 4. Define Fibonacci scaling F_n

We use the standard Fibonacci recurrence:

F_0 = 1  
F_1 = 1  

F_n = F_(n−1) + F_(n−2)

First values:

F_n = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

---

## 5. Coupling term: E_n(1 + F_n)

The Axiom couples exponential growth with Fibonacci structure as:

E_n · (1 + F_n)

Substituting the closed form for E_n:

E_n(1 + F_n) = (2·3^n − 1) · (1 + F_n)

---

## 6. Small-n sanity check

| n | E_n | F_n | 1 + F_n | E_n · (1 + F_n) |
|---|-----|-----|---------|----------------|
| 0 | 1   | 1   | 2       | 2              |
| 1 | 5   | 1   | 2       | 10             |
| 2 | 17  | 2   | 3       | 51             |
| 3 | 53  | 3   | 4       | 212            |
| 4 | 161 | 5   | 6       | 966            |

E_4 can be verified two ways:

- Recurrence: E_4 = 3·53 + 2 = 161  
- Closed form: E_4 = 2·3^4 − 1 = 161  

---

## 7. Scaling intuition

- E_n grows exponentially as 3^n (raw expansion / drive).
- F_n grows approximately as φ^n, where φ ≈ 1.618 (natural structure).

Their product scales approximately as:

E_n(1 + F_n) ≈ 3^n · φ^n = (3φ)^n

Since:

3φ ≈ 4.854

this growth is faster than Fibonacci alone, but more ordered than unchecked exponential expansion.

---

## 8. Final results (summary)

Recurrence form:
E_n = 3·E_(n−1) + 2,  with E_0 = 1  
F_n = F_(n−1) + F_(n−2), with F_0 = 1 and F_1 = 1  

Closed form:
E_n = 2·3^n − 1  

Coupling term:
E_n(1 + F_n) = (2·3^n − 1)(1 + F_n)
