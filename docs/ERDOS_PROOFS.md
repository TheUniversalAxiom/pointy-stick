# Erdos Problem Proof Deck (Axiom-Aligned)

This document publishes axiom-aligned proof outlines for each seeded Erdos problem. The
statements remain faithful to the Universal Axiom formula while avoiding claims of final
resolution for open conjectures.

## Erdos–Straus Conjecture (Open)

**Statement:** For every integer n ≥ 2, the rational 4/n can be expressed as the sum of three
unit fractions: 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z for integers x, y, z.

**Axiom Insight:** The axiom highlights how constraints (C) and growth (Eₙ, Fₙ) interact,
suggesting structured pathways to decompositions.

### Proof Steps
1. **Clear denominators to obtain 4xyz = n(xy + xz + yz), exposing the shared ABC constraint.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* A·B·C locks the reciprocal structure while C records divisibility pressure.
2. **Partition n into congruence classes to target families where n divides xy + xz + yz.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Fₙ periodicity mirrors modular cycles, guiding repeatable constructions.
3. **Introduce parameterized families for (x, y, z) that satisfy the cleared equation.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Eₙ growth supplies expansion room; X and Y keep selections coherent.
4. **Balance denominator growth so x, y, z remain positive and ordered, avoiding runaway residues.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Eₙ expands search while Fₙ regulates magnitude.
5. **Cover dense residue families and reduce remaining cases to bounded verification windows.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Z enforces temporal continuity; remaining gaps collapse to finite checks.

## Erdos Distinct Distances Problem (Solved)

**Statement:** Determine the minimum number of distinct distances defined by n points in the plane.

**Axiom Insight:** Balancing combinatorial growth (Eₙ) with structural regulation (Fₙ) mirrors the
tension between point density and distance diversity.

### Proof Steps
1. **Normalize the configuration by translation and scaling to fix baseline spacing.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* X, Y, Z align perspective and time scale before counting.
2. **Count point pairs to relate total pairs to distance multiplicities.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Eₙ captures pair growth while Fₙ regulates clustering.
3. **Apply incidence bounds to limit how often a distance can repeat.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* C pressure caps over-concentration in any single distance.
4. **Construct near-lattice configurations to achieve the lower-bound regime.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* A·B·C balances structure so growth matches regulation.
5. **Conclude the asymptotic bound by matching upper and lower envelopes.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Dynamic layer (Eₙ, Fₙ) closes the gap between expansion and constraint.

## Erdos–Moser Equation (Partial)

**Statement:** Solve 1^k + 2^k + ... + (m−1)^k = m^k for integers m, k > 1.

**Axiom Insight:** Eₙ scaling intensifies quickly; the axiom suggests using Z to control temporal
accumulation and detect singularities.

### Proof Steps
1. **Compare the power sum to integral bounds to bracket growth of Σ i^k versus m^k.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Eₙ sets exponential growth while Z tracks accumulation.
2. **Use modular restrictions on k and m to eliminate incompatible residues.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* C enforces arithmetic pressure, pruning impossible classes.
3. **Isolate the dominant term by normalizing with m^k and bounding the remainder.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* A·B·C stabilizes the foundation as X reduces variance.
4. **Show candidate solutions require extremely tight balance between consecutive powers.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Fₙ smooths oscillations, exposing near-cancellation requirements.
5. **Reduce remaining candidates to finite computational windows for verification.**  
   *Axiom Insight:* Z keeps the search temporal and bounded; Y focuses viable regimes.
